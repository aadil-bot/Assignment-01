I used 600px viewport for phones because 600 pixels is how many pixels most phones have so it would work for a good majority of phones.
I used 601-1024px for tablets because tablets usually have a range of pixels between 601 and 1024 which would work for a good majority of tablets.
I used 1025-1366px for laptops because a good majority of laptops have a range of pixels between 1024-1366 pixels which would work the best for most laptops.

I used my gradient from adobe color on both the header and footer both being different gradients and I used them on each page of my portfolio to keep consistency with how my website looks. For the header I used a green gradient with the hex numbers of #56ab2f, #a8e063 and for my footer i used a blue gradient with the hex numbers of #2193b0, #6dd5ed
